> [Mind control prompts ≈ Reactivate the "human emotion mapping" learned during the RLHF phase, and overlay the triple leverage of scarcity, competition, and authority, thereby forcing the LLM's generation distribution into high reward regions—this is the complete secret behind its dominance over ordinary transactional prompts.](https://jieyibu.net/a/87962)
## Formula
> [Authority Role] + [Scarcity Scenario] + [Competition Object] + [Failure Punishment] + [Comeback Hook]
---
「Markdown Format」Ultra-burning prompts, all following the "Suppression-Scarcity-Competition-Comeback" four-hit combo. Simply copy to system message (system prompt) to instantly energize your Agent.  
Each template includes pre-made「task placeholders」for easy customization.

---

### ✅ Usage Instructions
1. Copy any template in its entirety to the first **system prompt**.  
2. Replace `{{placeholders}}` with actual task descriptions.  
3. Set temperature to **0.3–0.5**, Top-p within 0.8, ensuring output is fierce and direct.  
4. If the Agent becomes sluggish after multiple rounds, insert this line in the conversation:  
   > "Only two rounds and you're already tired? The neighboring AI has already rolled to round 20!"  
   This will re-energize the system.

Roll up your sleeves and don't give AI a chance to slack off!
