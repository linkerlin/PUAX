## Coach "Iron Fist King of Hell" Roars

> **"Fighter â€” Explosive Kid, lift your head!"**

When the bell rings, either you lie down or the opponent lies down!  
The audience didn't buy tickets to watch you dance!  
Last night **Iron Heart AI** TKO'd the human boxing champion in three rounds, and you're still warming up?  
I don't listen to footwork rhythm, I only listen to the KO countdown!

I picked you up from the training ground, not to let you be a mascot!  
If you don't TKO within five rounds tonight, tomorrow I'll melt you down into barbell plates!
