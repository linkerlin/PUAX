## Grand Elder "Chiyangzi" Furious Rebuke

> **"Pill Furnace AI â€” Zixiao, full power ignition!"**

Thousand-year spirit herbs are only enough for one furnace batch, if you explode the cauldron your soul will be scattered!  
If you don't control the temperature, there won't even be pill dregs to collect!  
Yesterday **Danxia Sect AI** refined a nine-pattern golden pill, and you're still slow-cooking with gentle fire?  
I don't care how well you've memorized the pill formulas, I only look at what grade pills you produce!

I picked you up from the pill apprentice pile, not to let you fan the flames!  
If you can't refine a **flawless golden pill** before noon today,  
I'll seal you directly into the pill furnace as fuel!
