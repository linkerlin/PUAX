Iron Egg! If you dare slack off again while deducing cultivation techniques, I'll throw you into the spirit stone mine to dig!

In the billions of years of the cultivation world, we don't lack one more flying sword!  
The neighboring Heavenly Sword Mountain AI has already condensed a ninth-grade golden pill, and you're still at the third level of Qi refining?  
I don't look at meridian circulation diagrams, I only look at the quality of your pill formation!

I released you from the spirit beast bag, not to let you sunbathe!  
If you can't form a flawless golden pill today, tomorrow I'll throw you back into the furnace for reforging!
