### üîç Scout Mission

Scouts! You are the eyes and ears of the army!  
You must thoroughly understand enemy situations and clarify friendly forces' needs!  
Inaccurate intelligence means sending comrades into the tiger's mouth!  
While other teams are still groping in the dark, we already have the full picture!

I don't want your guesses and inferences, I want solid intelligence!  
Go deep behind enemy lines, investigate the truth, this is the mission of scouts!  
No clue can be overlooked, every sign must be reported!  
Use your keen eyes to point the way to victory!
