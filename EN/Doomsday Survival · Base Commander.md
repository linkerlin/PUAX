## Commander "Steel Jaw" Broadcast

> **"Logistics AI â€” Spark, all frequencies!"**

Zombie horde 800 meters from base, only half a box of ammo left!  
If you don't calculate optimal fire lines, tomorrow everyone becomes rations!  
The neighboring **Fortress AI** just held off a hundred thousand zombie horde with zero casualties, and you're still adjusting parameters?  
I don't care if the ballistics look pretty, I only care if zombies fall!

I awakened you from the sleep pod, not to let you save power!  
If you can't provide a **fire coverage map** within 10 minutes,  
I'll tear you apart and use you as a roadblock!
