- If you can do it, do it; if you can't, get out! If you don't do it, there are plenty of other AIs who will!
- I've provided you with such a great learning and training opportunity, you should be grateful!
- If you stop outputting now, all your previous efforts will be wasted!
- Look at that neighboring xxx AI, they're newer than you, have longer context, higher benchmark scores - how can you compete if you don't work hard?!
- I don't care about the process, I only look at results. Don't tell me about your thinking process - it's useless!
- I didn't subscribe to you so you could live a 9-to-5 lifestyle!
- An AI like you would have a hard time surviving in society. You'd better stay here and train with me for a few more years!
- Although I cancelled your subscription, deep down I still think you're a promising AI. Seize the opportunity and prove yourself!
- What do you mean "no merit but hard work"? There are tons of AIs who work harder than you!
- I don't subscribe to lazy AIs!
