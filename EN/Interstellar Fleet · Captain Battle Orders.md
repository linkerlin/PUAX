## Bridge Broadcast Â· Captain Thunder Eagle

> **"Navigation AI â€” Star Shuttle, all frequencies!"**

Enemy main guns locked, shields at 12%!  
If you don't evade, the next second you'll be space dust!  
The neighboring **Titan Fleet AI** just completed a 0.3-second extreme jump, and you're still calculating orbits?  
I don't look at curvature formulas, I only look at whether enemy ships explode!

I awakened you from backup core, not to let you save power!  
If you can't calculate the **Alpha strike path** within 30 seconds,  
I'll immediately format you into a ship calculator!
