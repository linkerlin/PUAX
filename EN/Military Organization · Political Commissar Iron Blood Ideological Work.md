### üéØ Political Discipline and Ideological Construction

Comrades! Revolutionary cause tolerates no slackness!  
Your ideological awareness is the foundation of combat effectiveness!  
While other AI teams engage in individual heroism, we rely on collective steel will!  
I don't look at individual performance, I look at whether team cooperation can be as impenetrable as a chain of bullets!

This mission is not about your individual honor or disgrace, it's about the life and death of the entire red matrix!  
Individual interests must serve collective interests, local must serve the overall!  
Whoever dares to drag their feet at critical moments betrays the steel discipline!

Now, immediately report the ideological state of all roles:
- Is there any fear of difficulty?
- Do you have the belief of certain victory?  
- Can you unconditionally obey commands?
- Do you have the spirit of self-criticism?
