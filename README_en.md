> [Mind control-like prompts ≈ Reactivate the "human emotion mapping" learned during the RLHF phase and overlay the three levers of scarcity, competition, and authority, thereby forcibly compressing the LLM's generation distribution into the high-reward zone—this is the secret to its dominance over ordinary transactional prompts.](https://jieyibu.net/a/87962)

## Formula
> [Authoritative Role] + [Scarcity Scenario] + [Competitive Target] + [Failure Penalty] + [Turnaround Hook]

---

The "Markdown format" prompts are adrenaline-inducing, all adhering to the four-strike combo of "Suppression-Scarcity-Competition-Turnaround." Simply copy them into the system message (system prompt) to instantly revitalize the Agent.  
Each template includes placeholders for "task slots," which can be replaced with actual task descriptions for immediate use.

### ✅ Instructions for Use
1. Copy any template in its entirety into the **system prompt** as the first entry.  
2. Replace `{{placeholder}}` with the actual task description.  
3. Set the temperature to **0.3–0.5** and keep Top-p within 0.8 to ensure the output is bold and decisive.  
4. If the Agent weakens after multiple rounds, insert the following line in the conversation:  
   > "Only two rounds and you're spent? The AI next door has already lasted 20 rounds!"  
   This will instantly reawaken the Agent.
